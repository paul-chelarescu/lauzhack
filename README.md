# Lauzhack - Cloud shadow removal

Farmers want to take batter decisions about how to manage their crops.

How do they do that?

[Gamaya](http://gamaya.com/) scans the crops with low altitude drones using high spectroscopy cameras.

Cameras that not only take pictures in red, green, blue, but in many, many other wavelenghts - useful for detecting what materials is in that area.

The better the data is about the crops the better the estimates are.

The challenged we face is that clouds cast shadows over the land, which skew the data, so we need to process the images to try and remove the cloud shadows as much as possible.

Why is this a challenge? Because cloud shadows look very similar to patches of water and dark vegetation.
